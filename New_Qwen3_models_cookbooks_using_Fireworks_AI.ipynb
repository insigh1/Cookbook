Let me recall what Euler's totient function does. φ(n) counts the number of integers less than n that are coprime to n, and it's multiplicative, right? Also, for a prime power p^k, φ(p^k) = p^k - p^(k-1) = p^(k-1)(p - 1). So maybe I should start by thinking about the general form of n such that φ(n) = n/3.\n",

Wait, but we also have the equation ∏p_i = 2∏(p_i -1). Let's take the smallest case with k=1 (odd): p=2∏(p-1)? Wait, k=1: p=2(p-1) ⇒ p=2p-2 ⇒ p=2, but p≥5 for odd m, so no. k=3 (next odd): pqr=2(p-1)(q-1)(r-1). Smallest three primes ≥5: 5,7,11: 5*7*11=385; 2*4*6*10=480; 385 < 480. Next, 5,7,13: 5*7*13=455; 2*4*6*12=576; still less. 5,11,13: 715; 2*4*10*12=960; less. 7,11,13: 1001; 2*6*10*12=1440; less. As primes increase, LHS grows like pqr, RHS like 2pqr (since (p-1)≈p), so actually RHS is roughly twice LHS for large primes, so LHS < RHS always for k=3? Wait, for k=1, LHS=p, RHS=2(p-1), so p < 2p-2 ⇒ p>2, which is true, so LHS < RHS for k=1. For k=2 (even, but we saw k must be odd for mod 3, but just checking): pq=2(p-1)(q-1). Smallest p=5,q=7: 35 vs 2*4*6=48, 35<48. p=5,q=11:55 vs 2*4*10=80, still less. Always LHS < RHS? Let's see: pq - 2(p-1)(q-1) = pq - 2(pq - p - q +1) = -pq + 2p + 2q - 2 = -(pq - 2p - 2q + 4) + 2 = -(p-2)(q-2) + 2. For p,q ≥5, (p-2)(q-2) ≥3*3=9, so this is ≤ -9 + 2 = -7 <0, so yes, pq < 2(p-1)(q-1) for p,q ≥5. For k=3: pqr - 2(p-1)(q-1)(r-1). Let's expand RHS: 2(pqr - pq - pr - qr + p + q + r -1) = 2pqr - 2pq - 2pr - 2qr + 2p + 2q + 2r - 2. So LHS - RHS = pqr - [2pqr - ...] = -pqr + 2pq + 2pr + 2qr - 2p - 2q - 2r + 2 = -[pqr - 2pq - 2pr - 2qr + 2p + 2q + 2r - 2] = -[(p-2)(q-2)(r-2) - 8]?

Seems like always negative, so LHS < RHS for k=3. For k=5: even more negative, since each additional prime factor multiplies LHS by p, RHS by 2(p-1)≈2p, so RHS grows faster, so LHS - RHS becomes more negative. Wait, but earlier when we computed the product p/(p-1), for k=6 primes, product was ~1.949 <2, so ∏p_i / ∏(p_i -1) <2 ⇒ ∏p_i < 2∏(p_i -1), which matches LHS < RHS. For k=7, product ~2.037 >2, so ∏p_i > 2∏(p_i -1). Wait, so for k=7, LHS > RHS? Let's check smallest seven primes ≥5: 5,7,11,13,17,19,23. Compute LHS=5*7*11*13*17*19*23. Let's compute step by step: 5*7=35, *11=385, *13=5005, *17=85085, *19=1,616,615, *23=37,182,145. RHS=2*(4*6*10*12*16*18*22). Compute inside: 4*6=24, *10=240, *12=2880, *16=46,080, *18=829,440, *22=18,247,680. Multiply by 2: 36,495,360. Now compare LHS=37,182,145 vs RHS=36,495,360. Oh! LHS > RHS here, which matches the product being >2. So for k=7, smallest primes give LHS > RHS, but is it equal? 37,182,145 - 36,495,360 = 686,785 ≠0, so not equal. What if we replace the largest prime 23 with a larger prime, say 29: LHS becomes 37,182,145 /23 *29 ≈37,182,145*1.2609≈46,880,000; RHS becomes 36,495,360 /22 *28 ≈36,495,360*1.2727≈46,440,000, so LHS still bigger, difference larger. Replace with smaller prime? But 23 is the 7th prime ≥5, can't go smaller. What if we take a different set of seven primes, not the smallest? Like replace 5 with a larger prime, say 7,11,13,17,19,23,29: LHS=7*11*13*17*19*23*29, which is way bigger than before, RHS=2*6*10*12*16*18*22*28, also bigger, but LHS/RHS would be (7/6)(11/10)...(29/28) which is less than the product for smallest seven primes (since we replaced 5/4 with 7/6 <5/4), so product <2.037, maybe closer to 2? Let's compute the product: original smallest seven: 5/4*7/6*11/10*13/12*17/16*19/18*23/22≈2.037 as before. If we replace 5 with 7, so primes 7,11,13,17,19,23,29: product=7/6*11/10*13/12*17/16*19/18*23/22*29/28. Let's compute step by step: 7/6≈1.1667, *11/10=1.2833, *13/12≈1.3903, *17/16≈1.4772, *19/18≈1.5561, *23/22≈1.6233, *29/28≈1.6805 <2.037, still greater than 2? 1.68 <2, yes, so product≈1.68 <2, so LHS < RHS here. Wait, so depending on the primes, for seven primes, product can be >2 or <2, but is there any combination where it's exactly 2?\n",

            "This seems messy, but maybe there's a better way. Let's recall that for the equation 2φ(m)=m, we already saw that if m is a power of 2, it works: m=2^s, s≥1, since φ(2^s)=2^s -2^(s-1)=2^(s-1), so 2φ(m)=2*2^(s-1)=2^s=m. What if m has another prime factor? Suppose m=2^s * t, where t>1, odd, gcd(2,t)=1. Then φ(m)=φ(2^s)φ(t)=2^(s-1)φ(t), so 2φ(m)=2*2^(s-1)φ(t)=2^s φ(t)=m=2^s t ⇒ φ(t)=t.
